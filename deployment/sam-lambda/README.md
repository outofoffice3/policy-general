# Deploying Custom AWS Config Rule & Lambda Function

UNDER DEVELOPMENT

## Requirements

* AWS CLI already configured with Administrator permission
* [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)
* [Golang](https://golang.org)
* SAM CLI - [Install the SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)

## Setup process

UNDER DEVELOPMENT 

# Appendix

### Golang installation

Please ensure Go 1.x (where 'x' is the latest version) is installed as per the instructions on the official golang website: https://golang.org/doc/install

A quickstart way would be to use Homebrew, chocolatey or your linux package manager.

#### Homebrew (Mac)

Issue the following command from the terminal:

```shell
brew install golang
```

If it's already installed, run the following command to ensure it's the latest version:

```shell
brew update
brew upgrade golang
```

#### Chocolatey (Windows)

Issue the following command from the powershell:

```shell
choco install golang
```

If it's already installed, run the following command to ensure it's the latest version:

```shell
choco upgrade golang
```

## Bringing to the next level

Here are a few ideas that you can use to get more acquainted as to how this overall process works:

* Create an additional API resource (e.g. /hello/{proxy+}) and return the name requested through this new path
* Update unit test to capture that
* Package & Deploy

Next, you can use the following resources to know more about beyond hello world samples and how others structure their Serverless applications:

* [AWS Serverless Application Repository](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/)
